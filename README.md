# GitHub Pages Website

_Welcome!_

</header>

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. The site serves as a platform to showcase some of my (academic) achievements and share blog posts on topics such as cybersecurity and other projects that I am passionate about. Maintaining this website not only provides a space to document my work but also motivates me to stay engaged with ongoing projects and reflect on the knowledge and skills I have developed so far.

If you want to contact me, feel free to send me an [e-mail](mailto:jansneeuw@web.de).
