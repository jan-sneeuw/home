## 1 Introduction

The room *MalBuster* in the *Malware Analysis* module on TryHackMe.com constitutes the first "challenge" in the sense that we are asked to use the tools and tricks we learned in the preceding rooms to analyse a given set of malicious files that are stored in the attached VM. The task is to answer questions about these files, an thus prove that I am sufficiently proficient with tools like pe-tree, pestudio and capa.


## 2 Challenge

After starting the REMnux VM, the first thing I did was run the command 
```console
ubuntu@ip-10-10-80-81:~/Desktop/Samples$ pe-tree malbuster_1
```
in the terminal. After a couple of seconds pe-tree launched successfully. Looking at "Architecture" and "Characteristics" in FILE_HEADER gives the answer to the first two questions:

    alt="image"
    class="clickable-img h-auto w-auto max-w-full max-h-[232px] object-contain"
  />
</div>
<br>

> Q1: Based on the ARCHITECTURE of the binary, is malbuster_1 a 32-bit or a 64-bit application? (32-bit/64-bit)
> 
> A1: 32-bit

> Q2: What is the MD5 hash of malbuster_1?
>
> A2: 4348da65e4aeae6472c7f97d6dd8ad8f

For the next question, we navigate to virustotal.com in the browser and simply read off the answer:

> Q3: Using the hash, what is the popular threat label of malbuster_1 according to VirusTotal?
>
> A3: trojan.zbot/razy

Next, we run `pe-tree` on the second malware `malbuster_2`. We paste its MD5 hash into virustotal.com to view further information about its severity and impact according to third-parties.

    alt="image"
    class="clickable-img h-auto w-auto max-w-full max-h-[232px] object-contain"
  />
</div>
<br>

> Q4: Based on VirusTotal detection, what is the malware signature of malbuster_2 according to Avira?
>
> A4: HEUR/AGEN.1306860
