## About Me ðŸš§  **Work In Progress!**  ðŸš§

<img src="/home/uploads/image.png" alt="My photo" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 25px 25px; width: 185px; border-radius: 15px;">

I obtained my Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Bonn in September 2025 under supervision of Prof. Markus Hausmann and Dr. Andrea Bianchi. I specialized in Algebraic Topology and wrote my thesis on the Madsenâ€”Weiss Theorem.

Outside of mathematics I have gained extensive experience as a High-Performance-Computing Linux system administrator through an assistant position at the Institute for Numerical Simulation (INS) of the University of Bonn. In particular, I worked with tools such as FreeIPA, Ansible, Slurm and Zammad, to name a few. Moreover, I have a long-standing passion for cybersecurity. Both privately and through my work at the INS, I developed a solid foundation in IT-security and network technologies. I am currently deepening my expertise in penetration testing, complementing theory with practical experience through CTF challenges and by maintaining a [blog](/blog/) where I publish write-ups and summaries.
