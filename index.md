## About Me ðŸš§  **WIP!**  ðŸš§

<div class="about-me">

<img src="/home/uploads/image.png" alt="My photo" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 35px; width: 190px; border-radius: 15px;">

I obtained my Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Bonn in September 2025 under supervision of Prof. Markus Hausmann and Dr. Andrea Bianchi. I specialized in Algebraic Topology and wrote my thesis on the Madsenâ€”Weiss Theorem.<br><br>

Outside of mathematics I have gained extensive experience as a High-Performance-Computing Linux system administrator through an assistant position at the Institute for Numerical Simulation (INS) of the University of Bonn. In particular, I worked with tools such as FreeIPA, Ansible, Slurm and Zammad, to name a few. Moreover, I have a long-standing passion for cybersecurity. Both privately and through my work at the INS, I developed a solid foundation in IT-security and network technologies. I am currently deepening my expertise in penetration testing, complementing theory with practical experience through CTF challenges and by maintaining a <a href="https://jan-sneeuw.github.io/home/blog/">blog</a> where I publish write-ups and summaries.

## Current Projects
Here are a few things Iâ€™ve been working on:

- [**CySec Blog**](/blog/) â€” A blog where I occasionally publish write-ups on cybersecurity concepts and challenges I find noteworthy.
- [**ML Project**](https://github.com/yourusername/project-two) â€” I am looking to get more into Machine Learning and plan to follow old exercises of a Practical Lab taught at the University of Bonn in 2025.
- [**SEC Trading Project**](https://github.com/yourusername/project-two) â€” I am planning to develop a trading algorithm depending on a subset of high-volume purchases of stocks listed by the SEC. In particular, I want to compare varying strategies through systematic backtesting to determine the degree of profitability.

## Past Projects
Here are some miscellaneous projects that I have worked on in the past.

- [**Penetration Test**](/home/uploads/Pentest_Report.pdf) â€” Authorized penetration testing of the domain Bikeseek.org using common tools such as Burpsuite. Successful XSS-attack documented.
- [**Collaborative Text Editor**](https://github.com/jan-sneeuw/Collaborative-Text-Editor) â€” Developed a collaborative text-editor using e.g. Javascript, Node.js and socket.io. Comparable to a simplified version of Google-Docs.

## Mathematics
Below is a selection of seminar notes that I have written over the past few years.
- [Homotopy Groups of Wedges of Spheres](/home/uploads/Homotopy_Groups_of_Wedges_of_Spheres.pdf) â€” brief summary.
- [Eilenbergâ€”MacLane Spaces](/home/uploads/EM-spaces.pdf) â€” brief summary.

### Theses
- Master: [The Madsenâ€”Weiss Theorem](/home/uploads/Thesis_Jan.pdf) â€” First proven in 2004, the MW-Theorem says that the stable homology of $B\text{Diff}(\Sigma_g)$, for $\Sigma_g$ a surface of genus $g$, is given by a certain infinite loop space $\Omega^\infty_\bullet\mathbf{\Psi}$. Importantly, it resolves the famous Mumford Conjecture, stating that there is an isomorphism of rings $H^*(\Gamma_\infty;\mathbb{Q}) \cong \mathbb{Q}[\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\ldots]$ where $\Gamma_\infty$ denotes the mapping class of $\Sigma_\infty$ and $\vert\kappa_i\vert = 2i$.
- Bachelor: [The Lyndonâ€”Hochschildâ€”Serre Spectral Sequence](/home/uploads/LHS_corr.pdf) â€”
