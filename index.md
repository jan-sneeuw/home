## About Me
I obtained my Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Bonn in September 2025 under supervision of Prof. Markus Hausmann and Dr. Andrea Bianchi. I specialized in Algebraic Topology and wrote my [thesis](/home/uploads/Thesis_Jan.pdf) on the Madsen--Weiss Theorem.

I have experience in HPC-Linux-Systemadministration (TBA) and a long-standing passion for cybersecurity
