## About Me
 
**This is still work in progress!**

I obtained my Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Bonn in September 2025 under supervision of Prof. Markus Hausmann and Dr. Andrea Bianchi. I specialized in Algebraic Topology and wrote my thesis on the Madsen—Weiss Theorem.

I have experience in HPC-Linux-Systemadministration (TBA) and a long-standing passion for cybersecurity.
