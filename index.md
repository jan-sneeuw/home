## About Me
 
ðŸš§  **This is still work in progress!**  ðŸš§

I obtained my Master's Degree in Mathematics at the University of Bonn in September 2025 under supervision of Prof. Markus Hausmann and Dr. Andrea Bianchi. I specialized in Algebraic Topology and wrote my thesis on the Madsenâ€”Weiss Theorem.

I have experience in HPC-Linux-Systemadministration (TBA) and a long-standing passion for cybersecurity.
